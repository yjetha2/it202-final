__Final exam practical__

In this practical portion, you'll make a number of updates to this app.

1. Replace "Your UIN Here" with your UIN.

2. Update the color scheme for the app to use a different color for the top bar and buttons.   

3. The APOD page makes a call to NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API.  Update the page to display the picture in a card like the one at https://material-components.github.io/material-components-web-catalog/#/component/card?type=basic . Display the image (use the url property), title, copyright, and date information. 

4. Replace the bottom buttons on that card with one that displays "View HD Image" and which opens a new tab with that HD Image.

5.  Get the geolocation and center the map to the current location.

6. The Search Schools page shows school information.  Update the page with a select control to let users search by school category; the options are in a variable on that page.  When the button is clicked, use the selected value to modify the URL on the AJAX call.

7.  Update the school display to add the school id on the first line and the address on the second line.

8.  Include a display of the number of records records returned.

9.  Add markers to the map object for the schools.

10.  On the canvas page, draw a blue circle on a red background.
